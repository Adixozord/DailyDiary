Daily Diary project.

Main assumptions:
> possibilities for users:
   - creating and logging into account
   - sorting logs into default categories (for example, actual mood) 
   - creation and management of users logs (public / private)
   - show all logs
   - show details of log
> site possibilities:
   - find logs which contain specific word, user, date
> logs:
   - comments
